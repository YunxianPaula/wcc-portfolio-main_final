                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>You may initially resist, fueled by determination, yet the relentless struggle will eventually lead to exhaustion and surrender.</p>
                   <p>This interactive installation delves into the phenomenon of herd behavior through an economic lens, drawing parallels between the patterns of a bubble economy and the behaviors of organism-like creatures. By constructing a biological model or sand table, the installation vividly portrays the contemporary reality of individuals entrapped within the grasp of the bubble economy, stripped of agency and influence.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The installation's primary objective is to evoke a sense of empathy within the audience, inviting them to recognize their own roles as unwitting participants, much like sheep succumbing to various trends. The overarching intention is to ignite contemplation on the pervasive sway of these trends, prompting viewers to contemplate and embrace independent thought.

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>Conformity:</p>
                   <p> Conformity is when a person's behaviour or opinion changes as a result of real or imagined pressure from another person or group [1]. This phenomenon is attributed to the social attributes of human beings.And we human beings have a fully free sense of individuality, we will always think that our actions are made after our own judgement and thinking, and it is very difficult for others to influence what we say and do.
                    
                    Therefore, it is not difficult to find that we are often in a state of tension and conflict between our personal values and the values required by society. And in many situations, without us realising it, we are influenced by those around us.
                   </p>
                    <p>
                    Two big reasons for this:</p>
                    <p>1. following the crowd by making sure that what we say and do is right and appropriate
                    In many situations, the incomplete information, unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the situation leads us to need to judge how to proceed to the next step by the words and actions of others. Often, what others say and do is our only guide to appropriate action, and this guide is generally correct.
                    At the same time, when it comes to expressing attitudes and opinions, we often need to rely on the opinions of others in order to understand what needs to be discussed, because groups of people are always able to provide the valuable information we expect.
                    And since there is a limit to what one person can know, we need to listen to new information provided by others to assist us in our thinking. If the information provided by the majority of people and the opinions expressed on the basis of it are generally consistent, we will inevitably feel that this is likely to be the case and adopt it as our own, or begin to doubt ourselves even if we initially had some ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2. Subordination by gaining favour by living up to peer expectations
                    In general, group members act in accordance with the norms of the group - whether they are explicitly stated rules and regulations or default underlying rules. When they deviate from such group norms, members feel invisible group pressure and are ostracised by the group for fear of deviating from it. Therefore, conformity is a safer option - even if the individual does not recognise it.
                    Research has found that the more privacy an individual has, the more free they are from group pressure, and therefore the less likely they are to follow the herd. Both objective tasks such as judging the length of a straight line [2] and subjective tasks such as evaluating the aesthetic value of a work of art [3] show that people are less likely to succumb to the judgements of others when answering individually. </p>
               
                    <p>
                    Other factors affecting subordination:</p>
                    <p>consistency.</p>
                   <p> A key reason that determines whether a person will follow the majority opinion is - whether the majority opinion is consistent.
                    In a group where everyone has a different opinion, it's easier for you to come up with your own ideas because the group is an atmosphere where you can speak your mind and express your opinion. If everyone's opinion is very unanimous, then even if your idea is a little different, you will think twice before you open your mouth to speak freely: how come everyone is so unanimous? Will I be rejected if I think differently? Is what I think really right?
                    individual personality differences.</p>
                   <p> For example, people with low self-esteem are more likely to succumb to group pressure compared to people with high self-esteem [1].
                    Self-esteem is simply how one views oneself, whether or not one is confident in oneself, and how valuable one believes oneself to be. If a person is very confident and has a high sense of self-worth, then even in the face of group pressure, he is likely to resist the pressure to dissent, or at least not blindly follow the crowd without an opinion of his own.
                    Cultural differences.
                    The influence of collectivist and individualist orientations in the East and West on the phenomenon from which it occurs is obvious.Â 
                    In an analysis of roughly 133 experiments from 17 countries [5], researchers found that the phenomenon of following the crowd is more common in collectivist societies (e.g., China, Japan) than in individualist societies (e.g., the United States, France).</p>
                <p>Economic Context:</p>
                    <p>Social Identity Theory</p>
                </p> Social identity theory suggests that individuals strive to achieve identification with the group to which they belong while pursuing differentiation from other groups during social interactions[4]. In the context of consumerism, people achieve identification and differentiation from others through material consumption to strengthen their social status and self-worth.</p>
                   <p> Social influence theory</p>
                  <p> Social influence theory states that individuals' behaviours and perceptions are influenced by others, especially under information uncertainty and group pressure [6]. The consumerist environment makes people susceptible to the influence of advertisements, social media and peers, which leads to behavioural patterns of overconsumption and unconscious materialistic pursuits.</p>
                   <p> Motivation Theory</p>
                  <p> Motivation theory emphasises the intrinsic drive behind individual behaviour [7]. In the context of consumerism, people's consumption behaviour is often driven by psychological needs such as self-esteem, sense of belonging, and social status. These needs make them more susceptible to consumerism, which further leads to overconsumption and materialistic pursuits. </p>
                <p> It follows that people in an economic context are often forced to follow, consume and so on unconsciously because they want to make sure that they are in line with the masses and find it difficult to fight against group pressures and become part of the herd.</p>

                <p>The camera installed on the ceiling to identify the trajectory of the transparent ball rolling in the sandbox, read and process the data, through the p5.serial control sent to the Arduino, to control the different orientation of the air pump to inflate or inhale the balloon to lift or put down, drive the sandbox, promote the action of the ball on the sandbox, the material used in the production of a very thin and lightweight foam board to make the sandbox to facilitate the The air pump blows up the balloon to change the angle of rotation of the sandbox easily.
                </p>
                <p>In the rotation mode of the sand table, I chose random, because the economy is also uncontrollable, but it is regular. When people try to use their hands to change the established laws of the sand table, they may be awakening and try to resist the established laws and fight against the herd effect, but when they let go of their hands, the sand table will still drive the ball according to the established trajectory, unless the user It has been operating, which also means that it is difficult for people to change the consumption habits caused by the herd effect.</p>
                <p>Techniques involved:</p>
                <p>1, connect the external camera</p>
                <p>2, Moving pixel detection in p5.js to get the moving pixel orientation data and send it to Arduino via P5.serial controlAPP;</p>
                <p>3, Visualise the detected moving pixels as small blue tails, which follow the transparent sphere in real time; and set a black circular mask to facilitate perfect projection on the sandbox;</p>
                <p>4, Arduino gets the orientation data and converts it to control the pumping gas of 6 air pumps;</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The overall project is going well, I encountered a lot of problems during the process, such as choosing which P5.js to connect with the Arduino, which air pump to use to inflate and suck in the air will be faster, and which black circular mask will run more smoothly on the web page, all of these are basically solved in the constant testing. </p>
                <p>But the hardware issues are hard to solve, for example I used one L298N to connect 2 air pumps and connected 3 L298Ns in series, which means I need to connect 6 air pumps in series and use the maximum voltage of 12V, but the power is still not enough, and finally I had to change the strategy and connect 12V to each 2 air pumps separately, which means I need to give up some features.</p>
                <p>Also, running normal vision code on the computer slowed down once an external camera and projector were connected.</p>
                <p>In the future, if iterating my work, I will continue to work on improving the running efficiency to get the best visual results. Also continue to explore the voltage issues encountered on the hardware and so on.</p>
